# our first program 
print("Hello, world") # Hello, world

'''
print() is a function that is used to print out the result to the console.
Output of the above program is Hello world.
'''

# Functions: functions are actions that allows you to do any work in your program, like above we use print() function and it is used for printing the result to the console, similarly in python we have many other functions i.e. input() etc and these are built-in functions provided by language and python also allows us to create our own functions through which we can perform many actions/tasks and solve the problems


# bug: bug is a mistake/error in your program and it is beauty of the program, every programmer makes mistake and the he sought out the problem which is known as debugging, so committing errors and fixing those errors is known as debugging. 

# Example: print("hello, world" this code has a bug as I have not added the close parenthesis which is essential for print function and this program will throw us an error and to fix it we will add closing parenthesis to the end to fix this error, these types of issues occur in daily life programming and it is better to fix the errors by yourself as it will enhance your coding skills.



# Variables: A variable is a container that store some value, lets see below how variables are created in python

# created a name variable to hold user name
name = input("Enter your name? ")

# saying hello to user
print("Hello,", name, "\n")

# say hello to user using concat (combine str with + operator)
print("hello, " + name)
